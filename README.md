## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Manuel de Castro, a PhD. Researcher Candidate in Computer Architecture at Universidad de Valladolid (Spain). I specialize on High-Performance Computing (HPC), including heterogeneous computing, and using high-level programming models and tools to efficiently program heterogeneous and distributed systems.

I am currently researching the applicability of FPGAs as comodity acceelrators for HPC problems (complex tasks of scientific or engineering interest).

You can reach me at manuel@infor.uva.es.

See you around! ðŸ˜‰
